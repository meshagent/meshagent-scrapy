## [0.41.4]
- `ChatThreadSession` now exposes thread-start, turn-steer, and interrupt workflows, along with richer pending-input state and active-turn tracking for acceptance, application, and rejection events.
- Container and service models now support a `template` value (`agent` or `none`), and container runs can opt into that template to receive the standard agent runtime environment and mount defaults.

## [0.41.3]
- Stability

## [0.41.2]
- `meshagent create` now uses clearer stable focus IDs and labels, adds an Anthropic chatbot option, and prints grouped next steps plus agent-toolkit deploy guidance for backend-agent templates.
- `meshagent rooms list` now defaults to rooms the current user can access, with `--all` to switch back to listing every room in the project.
- Deploy-room prompting now derives the Pages suffix from the configured API host, pre-fills a room-based subdomain, and validates subdomain-only input before constructing the final public domain.
- The CLI chat and process runtime now centralize turn-toolkit assembly and thread-list tooling through the supervisor, while websocket chat sessions keep web participants aligned with the base participant identity for on-behalf-of access.

## [0.41.1]
- Python feed subscription APIs and CLI commands now support an optional `filename_datetime_format`, and listing shows the stored value.
- The create workflow now prints a `cd` hint for new subfolders and blocks reusing an already occupied nested folder.
- Image deploys now preserve Dockerfile default environment values and clear the newly built image from the room cache after a successful build.

## [0.41.0]
- Managed-agent support now includes thread listing, thread create/update/delete events, attachment names, and sender-name trust for chat input.
- Websocket process support now uses `/messages`, adds `jwt`/`iap`/`none` auth modes, and supports websocket-based `process use` sessions.
- Route handling now uses the spec-based route model and supports room or agent backends.
- The CLI gained new agent/process/route flows, removed the `codex` command, and added `ascii-magic~=2.3`, `pillow~=11.3.0`, and `msgpack~=1.1`.
- Managed-agent storage and shell toolkits were removed from the public managed-agent surface.
- OpenAI, Anthropic, browser, computer, and toolkit helpers were updated to work with the new managed-agent and client-toolkit plumbing.
- Fixed thread storage, chat replay, and process shutdown races.

## [0.40.3]
- Added managed-agent spec and API models covering allowed models, toolkits, secrets, MCP servers, thread isolation, agent/room grants, and agent session listing.
- Route APIs now use `RouteSpec` with room or agent backends and preserve compatibility with legacy route payloads.
- Chat and channel code now supports websocket transport, participant connect/disconnect events, sender-name propagation, and attachment-aware thread start/load flows.
- Added a new `create` scaffolder with Dart, .NET, JavaScript, Python, React, and TypeScript templates, replacing the old `init`/Codex entrypoints.
- Added CLI dependencies on `ascii-magic~=2.3` and `pillow~=11.3.0`.

## [0.40.2]
- Stability

## [0.40.1]
- Stability

## [0.40.0]
- Added realtime model selection, audio modality, and protocol negotiation support across the Python agents, CLI, OpenAI, and Anthropic adapters.

- Improved crawler, roompool, and offline-wait behavior for local routing and cached room provisioning.
- Added `sounddevice~=0.5` to the CLI dependency set.
- Removed the restored agent event metadata mirror, so downstream consumers now rely on the canonical event metadata source.

## [0.39.9]
- Added/expanded `meshagent init` and `meshagent doctor` CLI workflows in the Python SDK, including TUI init improvements.
- Expanded `meshagent doctor` to provide richer, toolchain-aware diagnostics (Python/TypeScript/.NET), including stronger deployment/runtime guidance and missing toolchain detection.
- Implemented dataset table rename support and SDK dataset toolkit support for renamed dataset handling.
- Improved dataset path restoration and dataset-backed conversation handling in the SDK.
- Implemented dataset thread storage in the SDK, including dataset thread storage/watch plumbing for dataset-scoped conversation threads.
- Added SDK wiring for error reporting and transaction reconciliation-related CLI behavior.

## [0.39.8]
- Added `rename_table` support to the Python datasets client API (`DatasetsClient.rename_table`) for renaming dataset tables with optional namespace/branch
- Updated image dataset schema to store the image data column as `large_binary` (instead of `binary`) for newly created datasets
- Updated scrapy/dataset schema handling to use `large_string` for large compressed text fields (including image `src`/`alt`)
- CLI: ask-style TUI now supports a configurable assistant label name
- CLI: `meshagent process use` now routes through a room chat-channel session and streams text deltas into the ask-style TUI

## [0.39.7]
- Documentation cleanup: removed stale archived Python example agents/services/webserver routes.
- Documentation cleanup: removed several Python service example entrypoints (browser, document author, presentation author, voice, voice proofreader, voice tools).

## [0.39.6]
- CLI help docs generation was rewritten to recursively render command documentation for lazy-loaded Click/Typer command trees, with more robust hidden/deprecated filtering and deterministic command-block generation.
- CLI help reference generation now normalizes command output to produce stable reference content.
- Skill package validation now permits missing top-level help command references for `webserver`.

## [0.39.5]
- Added Scrapy crawler HTML/content stripping configuration via new `strip` and `strip_order` inputs (including support for stripping `scripts`, `css`, `whitespace`, `clean`, and `image-data-urls`)
- Changed default behavior for `content_format="html"` to strip `scripts` and inline image data URLs while preserving the rest of the HTML (and updated `--clean` CLI usage to map onto the new stripping configuration)
- Changed the default Scrapy content row-count batch cap from 1000 to 100.
- Changed the default Scrapy content max batch delay from 5 minutes to 60 seconds.
- Added retry handling for transient Scrapy dataset write disconnects before skipping the failed content batch.
- Broke Scrapy dataset output schema by removing `links`, `link_urls`, `image_urls`, and reducing `images` to `src`/`alt` only; inline image data URLs are excluded from extracted images
- Changed index creation defaults: automatic creation no longer includes inverted/label indexes for removed link/image URL columns; `text` inverted index creation is now opt-in via `index_columns=("text",)`
- Updated generated dataset schema to apply ZSTD compression metadata to large string fields (including `text` and image fields)

## [0.39.4]
- Added Scrapy import concurrency controls via `concurrency=` and the example crawler `--concurrency` flag.
- Changed Scrapy imports to send a browser-like User-Agent by default while keeping `user_agent=` and `--user-agent` overrides.
- Added size-aware Scrapy content merge batching with `max_batch_bytes=` and the example crawler `--max-batch-bytes` flag.
- Changed the default Scrapy content row-count batch cap to 1000 and added time-aware flushing with `max_batch_delay=` and `--max-batch-delay`, defaulting to 5 minutes.
- Changed Scrapy imports to skip non-text responses by default unless a custom response filter is supplied.
- Breaking: Python scheduled-task client and spec models now use a `ScheduledTaskSpec` contract (including queue/container targeting) instead of separate queue/schedule/payload parameters.

- Updated scheduled-task client methods to support `room_id` filtering and the new spec-based request/response shapes.
- Added/updated CLI scheduled-task create/update flows to load the `ScheduledTaskSpec` from a YAML file and included new run-related CLI functionality.
- Removed generated CLI dataset functionality (including the previously available SQL-exec command).
- Added `croniter~=6.0` as a dependency to support cron parsing for scheduled tasks.

## [0.39.3]

- Updated OpenAI Responses adapter error handling to detect out-of-credits/`insufficient_quota` conditions and return a clearer non-retryable 402 response; also improved websocket error payload message extraction.
- Updated `meshagent-cli` default model selections from `gpt-5.4` to `gpt-5.5` across ask/chatbot/codex/task runner/mailbot/worker CLI flows.
