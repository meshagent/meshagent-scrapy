## [0.44.4]
- Breaking: `AgentSessionContext` no longer exposes `previous_messages` or `previous_response_id`; restore flows now operate from the current `messages` payload instead of maintaining a separate history buffer.
- OpenAI Responses restore now preserves encrypted reasoning metadata, normalizes legacy reasoning items, and forces stateless requests to use `store=False` while replaying the current context.
- Agent event handling and dataset thread storage now keep reasoning provider/model metadata so empty reasoning items with encrypted content can still be restored without losing the payload.
- Managed agents now share the `llm` backend abstraction, which changes thread creation and resume behavior and lets thread naming consider the selected provider/model plus audio attachments.
- Updated `typer` to `~=0.26.6`.

## [0.44.3]
- Stability

## [0.44.2]
- Base chat clients now expose an async event stream for consuming emitted agent payloads alongside listener callbacks.
- Messaging chat clients now distinguish first connect from reconnect, track participant add/remove events, and reopen open sessions when the agent returns.
- Restored session context now resolves stored room file URLs into inline attachments, including PDF and image handling for OpenAI- and Anthropic-style message content.
- Fresh turns no longer trigger redundant storage restoration when there is no prior thread history.

## [0.44.1]
- Stability

## [0.44.0]
- Python agent processes now support multiple thread storages, thread watch/unwatch flows, and storage-aware list/view routing for thread lifecycle operations.
- Thread startup now preserves better thread naming and metadata, including fallback names derived from message content and attachments when no explicit name is provided.
- Managed-agent server code now creates thread metadata earlier and persists thread naming information consistently through websocket-driven lifecycles.
- Single-room and Codex orchestration now avoid unnecessary toolkit-discovery waits and improve startup latency and initialization behavior.

## [0.43.4]
- Public room toolkit metadata now preserves annotations end-to-end, and the SDK exports tool-search metadata for consumers that need to discover searchable tools.
- Tool listings now round-trip annotations alongside tools and participant IDs, so extra toolkit metadata is no longer lost when clients read or write it.
- Agent and room message handling now keeps `created_at` timestamps through streamed deltas and live thread updates, improving ordering and replay consistency.
- Responses integration now supports tool namespaces and search across the Python agent tooling stack.

## [0.43.3]

## [0.43.2]
- Added backend-aware fields across agent messages and chat/session APIs in `meshagent-agents`, enabling multi-backend conversations, model changes, and room/thread opening flows.
- Breaking: `meshagent-codex` was reorganized around a dedicated process, supervisor, and thread-storage stack, so the old internal process/chat wiring moved.
- Removed the mandatory Codex binary wheel dependency and vendored the OpenAI Codex client into `meshagent-codex`.
- Added thread inspection and thread-storage diagnostics for Codex sessions, along with no-room process mode and improved inline attachment handling in the CLI.

- Added TUI image attachment support with `textual-image[textual]~=0.12.0`.
- Removed the hard dependency on the Codex binary wheel.

## [0.43.0]
- `meshagent-agents` now supports backend-aware multi-backend supervision, with backend metadata in thread/model messages, attachment-aware prompts, and backend-aware thread/model/realtime-audio operations.
- `meshagent-codex` was split into a dedicated process, supervisor, and thread-storage stack and now vendors `openai_codex`, with a new `meshagent-openai==0.42.2` dependency.
- `meshagent-cli` now uses Typer consistently, adds lazy command loading, image/PDF/file paste-and-drop handling for `ask`, thread-sidebar controls, and improved `doctor`, `create`, and deploy-room workflows, including new room-workspace and meeting templates.
- `meshagent-openai` now preserves image-generation call inputs and emits structured image-generation results, and the LLM proxy and agent server websocket auth path now accept the `meshagent-agent.` token prefix.

- The deploy flow now resolves completed builds to published digests, rewrites deploy plans to use the resolved image reference, and cleans up replaced built images after successful deploys.
- Room client shutdown is now cancellation-safe, so protocol teardown completes even if exit is cancelled mid-close.
- CLI API URL resolution now prefers `MESHAGENT_API_URL` before the persisted active URL, matching the explicit environment override users expect.

- Deploy TUI now supports copying selected text or the full deploy log buffer to the clipboard.

## [0.42.0]
- Added project lookup by key.
- Service and route specs now support container templates, `host_port`, and `stripPrefix`; route-path serialization omits `stripPrefix` when it is false.
- Room/container responses now expose structured port mappings instead of bare integers, which is a breaking shape change for container listings.
- Room creation and room-service helpers now carry annotations and permissions through the API.
- Container creation and room-client helpers now accept the `template` option.

## [0.41.10]
- Breaking change: several resource lookup commands now use `get` instead of `show`, including API keys, feeds, LLM loggers, mailboxes, registries, routes, services, sessions, storage, and subscriptions.
- Added `get` commands for projects, dataset branches, and webhooks, plus a `get` alias for memory inspection.

## [0.41.9]
- Deployment config models now carry an optional server version, and `meshagent config get version` can surface it.
- `meshagent` now performs a best-effort startup version check, warns when the installed client is older than the server, and `meshagent version` reports both client and server versions instead of the previous raw version string, so scripts that parse the old output need to update.

## [0.41.8]
- Stability

## [0.41.5]
- Stability

## [0.41.4]
- `ChatThreadSession` now exposes thread-start, turn-steer, and interrupt workflows, along with richer pending-input state and active-turn tracking for acceptance, application, and rejection events.
- Container and service models now support a `template` value (`agent` or `none`), and container runs can opt into that template to receive the standard agent runtime environment and mount defaults.

## [0.41.3]
- Stability

## [0.41.2]
- `meshagent create` now uses clearer stable focus IDs and labels, adds an Anthropic chatbot option, and prints grouped next steps plus agent-toolkit deploy guidance for backend-agent templates.
- `meshagent rooms list` now defaults to rooms the current user can access, with `--all` to switch back to listing every room in the project.
- Deploy-room prompting now derives the Pages suffix from the configured API host, pre-fills a room-based subdomain, and validates subdomain-only input before constructing the final public domain.
- The CLI chat and process runtime now centralize turn-toolkit assembly and thread-list tooling through the supervisor, while websocket chat sessions keep web participants aligned with the base participant identity for on-behalf-of access.

## [0.41.1]
- Python feed subscription APIs and CLI commands now support an optional `filename_datetime_format`, and listing shows the stored value.
- The create workflow now prints a `cd` hint for new subfolders and blocks reusing an already occupied nested folder.
- Image deploys now preserve Dockerfile default environment values and clear the newly built image from the room cache after a successful build.

## [0.41.0]
- Managed-agent support now includes thread listing, thread create/update/delete events, attachment names, and sender-name trust for chat input.
- Websocket process support now uses `/messages`, adds `jwt`/`iap`/`none` auth modes, and supports websocket-based `process use` sessions.

## [0.40.3]
- Added managed-agent spec and API models covering allowed models, toolkits, secrets, MCP servers, thread isolation, agent/room grants, and agent session listing.
- Route APIs now use `RouteSpec` with room or agent backends and preserve compatibility with legacy route payloads.
- Chat and channel code now supports websocket transport, participant connect/disconnect events, sender-name propagation, and attachment-aware thread start/load flows.
- Added a new `create` scaffolder with Dart, .NET, JavaScript, Python, React, and TypeScript templates, replacing the old `init`/Codex entrypoints.
- Added CLI dependencies on `ascii-magic~=2.3` and `pillow~=11.3.0`.

## [0.40.2]
